HW8 Recap:

We were actually able to get basically everything pretty nicely. There are two known issues:

1.) We have no keybindings working. According to the prompt, we did not have to get non-core features
working, so we elected to not implement this in the provider's interactive view.

2.) The labels sometimes stick around a little longer than they probably should (i.e, the "restarting"
status will remain after hitting the restart button until another action is hit).

But all other functions such as speed control, playback control, restarting, looping, and shape
selection are working properly.

The provider views can be accessed via the following "-iv" keywords:

text2, svg2, visual2, provider.

Our views can be accessed via the following "-iv" keywords:

text, svg, visual, interactive.
